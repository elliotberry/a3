# Adjective Adjective Animal 
![](./a3.jpg)

Cute slugs from the terminal in mere moemnts. Kinda random and reasonably unique human-readable ID strings using all the unique adjectives and animal names I could find online in 4 hours. 

This has been certified by NIST to be the cutest way to generate a unique ID.

Greatly expands work done by a-type [here](https://github.com/a-type/adjective-adjective-animal).
